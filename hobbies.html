  <h1>Interest and Hobbies</h1>
  <p>I have several different interests
    and hobbies that I like to focus on
    outside of work.</pr>

  <p>Currently, I dedicate several hours a day to studying a Full Stack Web
    Developer <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">course</a> with Udemy. In addition to that, I teach myself
    Japanese through a spaced
    repetition program called <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>; I
    am two years strong and still very
    far from fluent.</p>

  <p>I also like to focus
    my attention on my physical
    health and general wellbeing, so I
    exercise regularly and cook a
    range of healthy meals.
    Furthermore, I like to spend time
    with my family and friends, watch
    films/shows/<a href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/octo711">animes</a>, read <a href="https://myanimelist.net/mangalist/octo711">manga</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/octo711">play games on
      my PC</a>. I'm currently trying to
    complete a game called
    Bloodbourne, and let's just say
    there has been a proliferation of
    grey hairs since I started playing it.
    I'm also really into music, so I
    make too many <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ann80d0qm0v9cg5cby8bla3y4?si=ca1e4270e4074345">playlists</a> on
    Spotify. So far, one for each
    season, for the past two years and
    counting.</p>
